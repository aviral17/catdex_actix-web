A) Once the database is up and running, we can start setting up Diesel. 
Diesel provides a command-line tool, which you can install using this 
command:

Please run this command first:  ----> 1) sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

2) cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres

******************** ---------------------- *********

Diesel can work with different databases, like MySQL and SQLite. 
By default, the CLI will work with all of them, but here we use the 
--no-default-features and --features postgres flags to tell cargo to 
only install the PostgreSQL integration. You might get a warning about 
the ld linker not being able to find the pg library. This is because, during 
the installation process, the tool needs to compile with the PostgreSQL 
headers. You can install the header files with:

sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

We need to tell the "diesel" command-line tool about the databaseâ€™s 
URL through an environment variable. Whenever we want to connect to DATABASE, we can only do so via Environment variable by exproting it. 
Run this command in the terminal to set it:

1) << $  export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then run the diesel setup command in the Catdex project directory. 
This will create a migration folder to keep the schema migration files, and 
a diesel.toml configuration file to tell the "diesel" tool to update the 
src/schema.rs file every time the schema updates.
