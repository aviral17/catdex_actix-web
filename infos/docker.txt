A) docker run \
 --name catdex-db \
 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
 -p 5432:5432 \
 -d \
 postgres:12.3-alpine

B) Before we use Rust code to interact with the database, we can use 
the command-line client to test the database. Install the PostgreSQL 
command-line client psql with the following command9
:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client

C) PGPASSWORD=mypassword psql -h localhost -p 5432 --username=postgres -w   instead of this (non-working-> error) psql -h localhost -p 5432 --username=postgres --password=mypassword

************  The psql version you get from apt-get might not match your PostgreSQL 
server version. For most of the operations we are doing in this project, the 
version mismatch wonâ€™t cause any problem. But if you are experiencing issues, 
try installing the psql client with the matching version from https://www.
postgresql.org/download/.
   The username postgres is the default created by the postgres:12.3-alphine
